## Introduction
Welcome to the world of quantum computing!

Whether you're a developer or simply someone who wants to get a feel for what quantum computing is all about, this learning path is a great place to start exploring quantum computing and optimization.

Imagine you're the new member of a space crew. The spaceship is equipped with a computer that has access to the Azure Quantum servers on Earth and you can use the power of quantum to complete different tasks. During your training as a new crew member, you'll learn about quantum computing and optimization and how to use the Microsoft Azure Quantum service.

Welcome aboard!
