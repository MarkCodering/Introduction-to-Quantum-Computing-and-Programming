# Introduction to Quantum Computing and Programming
This lecture note aims to provide a introductory information on quantum computing and its programming language like Q# or Python. Q#, an open-sourced programming language created by Microsoft. Besides, QDK (Quantum Development Kit) is next-generation software development kit for quantum software solution design.

With the online resource opened by Mircsoft and other organisation, we would like to provide some introductory codes and documentation for the beginner in this field to gain access to the capability of quantum computing power.
